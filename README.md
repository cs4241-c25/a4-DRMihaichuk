## Pokemon Day Care
[Link for Render](https://a4-drmihaichuk.onrender.com)    
Here is the [Link for the Backend](https://a4-drmihaichuk-backend.onrender.com), but only use the first link to run actual project as the backend will only return a blank page





This assignment is much like my A3 with the user being able to see all Pokemon they own in one 
cohesive table being able to add, edit, and remove Pokemon.
The main difference between this assignment and A3 is that I have GitHub authentication for the user 
to login with, it is using the react framework and component design, and the css styling getting an overhaul
with the use of Tailwind CSS instead of Bootstrap.
